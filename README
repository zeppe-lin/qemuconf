qemuconf - simple qemu launcher with config support
===================================================
qemuconf is a tiny utility that executes qemu(1) with arguments
compiled from a configuration file.

This qemuconf distribution is a fork of Gottox' qemuconf version
0.2.1, commit 50b8369 (Thu Nov 17 2022).  The man page have been
rewritten in POD (Plain Old Documentation).  Added man page for
`qemuconf-import`.  Unnecessary service files have been removed.
