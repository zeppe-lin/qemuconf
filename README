ABOUT qemuconf

    This directory contains qemuconf, a tiny utility that executes

    This qemuconf distribution is a fork of Gottox' qemuconf version
    0.2.1, commit 50b8369 (Thu Nov 17 2022) with the following little
    differences:
    * the man page have been rewritten in POD
    * added qemuconf-import(1) man page
    * removed unnecessary service files
    See git log for further differences.
